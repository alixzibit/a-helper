UI Navigation
One of the primary goals of this utility is to utilize the gamepad in handheld device like in the ROG Ally to make UI interaction easier. A robust UI navigation and control is under development and testing. But for the time being the current implementation works with a little quirks as its still still work in progress.
Before running the application make sure your device is set to auto controller mode
- left stick or d-pad for movement,
-  A button for enter/clicks
-  When you are unable to focus or jump to an expected button or control you can tap Left button
which can cycle through all available UI elements on screen.
- Only when you are interacting with stop services screen you will need to manually tap or use right stick to click out of focus from the services table list when you want to navigate away from there
